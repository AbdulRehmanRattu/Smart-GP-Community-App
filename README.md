### 🛤️ Journey Mapping & User Flows
- **Journey Map:** Full flow from appointment search to post-consultation
- **User Flows:** 
  - Booking an appointment
  - Starting a video consultation

### ✏️ Wireframing
- **Low-Fidelity Sketches:** 5 core screens including Home, Profile, Booking, Payment, and Confirmation

### 🎨 High-Fidelity Prototypes
- Developed in Figma with focus on clarity, simplicity, and responsiveness
- Incorporated user feedback through iterative testing
